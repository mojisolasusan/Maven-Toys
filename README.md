## Introduction
Sales and inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called **Maven Toys.** The data given includes information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location. This project is done using SQL to derive insights and crucial questions to help the Mexican store make data-driven decisions. 

**_Disclaimer: All datasets are not real and do not represent any company, institution, or country, but just to demonstrate the capabilities of SQL._**

## Problem statement 
1.	Which product category drives the biggest profit? Is it the same across all stores?
2.	How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy store? How long will it last?
3.	Are sales being lost without out-of-stock products at certain locations?

## Skills/concepts demonstrated:
The following SQL concepts were incorporated in the analysis:

1.	Sorting and filtering e.g. Where, Group by, having, order by, and limit.
2.	Aggregate functions e.g., sum, average, and count.
3.	Sub queries.
4.	Joins e.g., Inner join, left join, and right join.
5.	SQL views and case statements.

## Analysis:
1.	The product category that drives the biggest profit is **Toys** with a total profit of **Â£5,092,081.66.** with **Airport** location ranking as the **lowest** category and  **Downtown** as the **highest** category.
